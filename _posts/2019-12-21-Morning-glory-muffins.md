Legend has it that the morning glory muffin was invented by Pam McKinstry of the
"Morning Glory Cafe" on Nantucket Island[^1]. I discovered it at Peet's Coffee
in LA. They don't seem to carry it anymore, so I learned to make it for myself.
This recipe makes 18 small-ish muffins.

Preheat oven to 350&deg;F

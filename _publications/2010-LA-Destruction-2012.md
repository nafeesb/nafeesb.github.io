For the movie “2012”, Digital Domain was tasked with destroying its home city of
Los Angeles... digitally. The destruction effects would be seen up close, and
there had to be a lot of it. The solution involved turning to geometric
fracturing tools, and rigid body dynamics (RBD) simulations. However, this
sequence was going to require two orders of magnitude more detail than we had
accomplished before.

The talk presented an RBD simulation authoring system called "Drop". The
software had a node-based workflow that was very useful for FX artists, and
inspired many other developers and software packages. I received an [Academy
Award for Technical Achievement](http://www.oscars.org/news/21-scientific-and-technical-achievements-be-honored-academy-awardsr) for this work.

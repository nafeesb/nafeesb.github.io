This course focuses on film and game production practices in the area of rigid
body and particle simulation and collision used in breaking objects and large
scale destruction. The course will cover production aspects such as authoring
tools and game engine integration, in addition to the computational and
algorithmic aspects. Starting with a brief introduction to the basic theory,
this course will continue with examples from specific films and games.
Interesting commonalities and differences between film and game practice will be
highlighted.

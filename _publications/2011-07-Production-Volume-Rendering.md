This courses showed how to render non-homogenous media like clouds. The interesting thing about this course was the participation of 6 visual effects studios, and 1 graphics software vendor.  Everyone's methods was based on ray-marching.  Ray marching is simple to implement, it's fast, and it's relatively easy to control.  Today ray marching has given way to physically based volumetric light transport simulation fully integrated inside a generic renderer.

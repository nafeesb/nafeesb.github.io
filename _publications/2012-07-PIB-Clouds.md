The techniques and workflow used to create a very art-directed digital sky in
the movie "Puss In Boots".  The story of DreamWorks Animation’s “Puss In Boots”
called for Puss and his crew to climb up to a world of clouds. Alongside natural
looking clouds, there would be trees and buildings made of clouds. The art
direction called for a lot of detail in the density, and “magic hour” lighting
tones with strong reds and blues. To achieve this effect we created a system
that took a rough digital sky set, created high resolution volumetric cloud
representations, and allowed artistic lighting controls with multiple scattering
effects.

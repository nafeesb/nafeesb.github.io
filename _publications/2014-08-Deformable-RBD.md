We present a fast and robust method of simulating flexible materials that offers
significant advantages over existing methods. Our approach supports complex
geometry (concave features, holes, selfintersections), requires no topology
restrictions, boasts fast collisions, maintains volume, is numerically-stable
for large time steps, and supports dynamic plasticity. Our approach provides an
intuitive solution for modeling the complex dynamics of deformable solids with a
predictable and production-friendly workflow.

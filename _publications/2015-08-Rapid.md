A particle system is a heavily used tool in every effects animation department
in the world. In this paper, we re-explore this well understood, and relatively
ancient technique. We present our design of Rapid, a modern, and easy to use
particle dynamics framework that seamlessly fits into procedural node graphs. We
discuss schemes for minimizing sub-frame evaluation of the dataflow graph,
including an improved collision model and simple methods for generating smooth
and continuous particle emissions. These techniques combined with improved
workflow tools enable artists to build production setups faster, and simulate
them quicker. The Rapid framework has been used on hundreds of shots at the
studio to produce effects like water, magic, debris, spray, dirt, embers, and
sparks.

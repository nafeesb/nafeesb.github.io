Mica is an autonomous, photoreal human character that runs on the Magic Leap One
spatial computing platform. The past ten years have seen tremendous improvements
in virtual character technology on screen, in film and games. Spatial computing
hardware such as Magic Leap One allows us to take the next step: interacting
with virtual characters off the screen. We believe that virtual characters who
are aware of and can interact directly with users in real-world environments
will provide a uniquely compelling experience.
